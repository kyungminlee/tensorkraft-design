# Technical Specification: `tk-dmrg`

**Crate:** `tensorkraft/crates/tk-dmrg`
**Version:** 0.1.0 (Post-Draft-Implementation)
**Status:** Draft
**Last Updated:** March 2026

---

## 1. Overview

`tk-dmrg` is the DMRG algorithm engine for the tensorkraft workspace. It sits above `tk-core`, `tk-symmetry`, `tk-linalg`, `tk-contract`, and `tk-dsl` in the dependency graph and is consumed by `tk-dmft`.

**Core responsibilities:**

- **MPS representation** — Matrix Product State types with typestate-enforced canonical forms (`LeftCanonical`, `RightCanonical`, `MixedCanonical`, `BondCentered`). Site tensors are `BlockSparseTensor<T, Q>` for symmetry-exploiting storage; the typestate system ensures gauge operations compile only on validly conditioned states.
- **MPO representation** — Matrix Product Operator construction from `OpSum` (via SVD-based finite-state automaton compression) and manual construction for special-purpose operators (identity, projectors). MPO site tensors have rank 4: (physical-in, physical-out, bond-left, bond-right).
- **OpSum → MPO compilation** — The only crate that performs the SVD compression step that translates an `OpSum` from `tk-dsl` into an `MPO`. This is runtime linear algebra; it must not happen at compile time in `tk-dsl`.
- **DMRG sweep engine** — Two-site and single-site sweep variants. The sweep engine updates MPS tensors via effective Hamiltonian diagonalization, SVD truncation, and environment renewal. The `MixedCanonical` typestate enforces that the gauge center is always well-defined.
- **Environment management** — Left and right environment block tensors accumulate the partial contraction of the MPS–MPO–MPS network. Environments are updated incrementally as the sweep moves, not recomputed from scratch each step.
- **In-house iterative eigensolvers** — Lanczos, Davidson, and Block-Davidson implementations written from scratch within this crate. External eigensolvers are not used because they cannot accommodate the zero-allocation `&mut [T]` matvec closure and `SweepArena` integration required for competitive performance (design doc §8.2 / §11).
- **SVD truncation with bond dimension scheduling** — Truncated SVD via `tk-linalg` with configurable `max_bond_dim`, absolute singular value cutoff, and per-bond truncation error tracking. Supports SU(2) multiplet-aware truncation under the `su2-symmetry` feature flag.
- **TDVP time evolution** — Time-Dependent Variational Principle (1-site TDVP with projector splitting), including Tikhonov-regularized bond-matrix inversion and site-tensor subspace expansion for entanglement growth. Used by `tk-dmft` for real-time Green's function computation.
- **Excited states** — Energy-penalized DMRG targeting excited states by projecting out previously converged eigenstates; Block-Davidson for targeting the lowest k states simultaneously.
- **Infinite DMRG bootstrap** — iDMRG warm-start of the finite DMRG sweep, producing an initial MPS at the target bond dimension before expensive finite sweeps begin.
- **Checkpointing** — Serialization and deserialization of `MPS`, `MPO`, and `Environments` to disk using `serde + bincode`, enabling sweep restarts after interruption.

**Key design principle:** This crate is the integration point. All performance-critical inner loops (GEMM, SVD, sector dispatch) are delegated to `tk-linalg` and `tk-contract`. What `tk-dmrg` owns is algorithm structure: sweep ordering, gauge management, eigensolver iteration, and the ownership discipline that separates persistent MPS tensors from sweep-temporary intermediates.

## 3. MPS Representation

### 3.1 Typestate Gauge Markers

```rust
/// Left-canonical form: all site tensors A[i] satisfy A[i]† A[i] = I.
/// The orthogonality center is to the right of the last site.
pub struct LeftCanonical;

/// Right-canonical form: all site tensors B[i] satisfy B[i] B[i]† = I.
/// The orthogonality center is to the left of the first site.
pub struct RightCanonical;

/// Mixed-canonical form: sites 0..center are left-canonical;
/// sites center+1..N are right-canonical. The orthogonality center
/// is at `center`. This is the required gauge for DMRG updates.
pub struct MixedCanonical {
    pub center: usize,
}

/// Bond-centered form: the singular value matrix between sites `left`
/// and `left+1` is exposed as a standalone `DenseTensor`. Required for
/// TDVP projector splitting (backward bond-matrix evolution).
pub struct BondCentered {
    pub left: usize,
}
```

### 3.2 `MPS<T, Q, Gauge>` Definition

```rust
/// Matrix Product State with typestate-enforced canonical form.
///
/// Site tensors are rank-3 `BlockSparseTensor<T, Q>` with legs ordered
/// (physical, bond-left, bond-right). Bond dimensions may vary per site.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// - `T`: scalar type (`f64`, `Complex<f64>`, etc.)
/// - `Q`: quantum number type (`U1`, `Z2`, `U1Z2`, etc.). All quantum number
///   types are small `Copy` types; `BitPackable` requires `Copy` as a supertrait
///   to avoid pervasive `.clone()` ergonomic friction (draft implementation finding).
/// - `Gauge`: typestate marker encoding the current canonical form

    /// Site tensors. Leg ordering: (σ, α_left, α_right).
    /// σ ∈ 0..local_dim[site]; α_left/α_right are bond indices.
    ///
    /// **Implementation requirement:** `BlockSparseTensor<T, Q>` must implement
    /// `Clone`. The draft implementation revealed that MPS cloning is needed for
    /// excited-state DMRG (penalized states), checkpointing, energy variance
    /// computation, and iDMRG bootstrap. This is HIGH SEVERITY: without `Clone`
    /// on `BlockSparseTensor`, none of these features are implementable.

    /// Bond matrices (singular value diagonal tensors) for BondCentered form.
    /// None in all other gauge forms.

## 4. MPO Representation

### 4.1 `MPO<T, Q>` Definition

```rust
/// Matrix Product Operator representation of a quantum Hamiltonian.

## 9. TDVP Time Evolution

### 9.1 Overview

The TDVP driver performs real-time (or imaginary-time) evolution of an MPS. It is used by `tk-dmft` to compute real-frequency Green's functions G(t), whose Fourier transform yields A(ω). The 1-site TDVP projector-splitting scheme is specified in design doc §8.1 and §8.1.1.

The forward site evolution computes `exp(-i H_eff dt/2) · |ψ_site⟩`. The backward bond evolution computes `exp(+i H_bond dt/2) · |S⟩` where S is the exposed bond matrix. Both use the Krylov matrix-exponential approximation (`exp_krylov`).

## 15. Feature Flags

| Flag | Effect in `tk-dmrg` |
|:-----|:--------------------|
| `backend-faer` | Propagates to `tk-linalg`; enables `DeviceFaer` for SVD/GEMM |
| `backend-oxiblas` | Propagates to `tk-linalg`; enables `DeviceOxiblas` for sparse ops |
| `backend-mkl` | Propagates to `tk-linalg`; enables FFI Intel MKL |
| `backend-openblas` | Propagates to `tk-linalg`; enables FFI OpenBLAS |
| `backend-cuda` | Propagates to `tk-core` and `tk-linalg`; `DMRGStats` gains `pinned_memory_fallbacks` counter |
| `su2-symmetry` | Propagates to `tk-symmetry` and `tk-linalg`; enables multiplet-aware SVD truncation (two-phase: sort + snap to multiplet boundary; (2j+1)-weighted truncation error) |

## 16. Data Structures and Internal Representations

### 16.1 Tensor Leg Ordering Convention

| Tensor | Rank | Leg order | Notes |
|:-------|:-----|:----------|:------|
| MPS site tensor A[i] | 3 | (σ, α_L, α_R) | σ = physical; α = MPS bond |
| MPO site tensor W[i] | 4 | (σ_in, σ_out, w_L, w_R) | w = MPO bond |
| Left environment L | 3 | (α_bra, w, α_ket) | bra above, ket below |
| Right environment R | 3 | (α_bra, w, α_ket) | same convention as L |
| Two-site tensor Θ | 4 | (σ_i, σ_{i+1}, α_L, α_R) | merged for 2-site update |
| Bond matrix S | 2 | (α_L, α_R) | diagonal; D × D |

**Naming conventions (draft implementation corrections):**
- `LegDirection` variants are `Incoming`/`Outgoing` (not the abbreviated `In`/`Out` used in earlier spec sketches).
- `QIndex` exposes `total_dim()` (not `dim()`) for the total dimension across all sectors.

### 16.2 Quantum Number Flow in U(1)-Symmetric MPS

The flux rule for each MPS site tensor A[i] with legs (σ, α_L, α_R):
```
q(σ) + q(α_L) - q(α_R) = 0
```
The outgoing bond α_R carries the cumulative charge of sites 0..i. The total charge of the MPS is the charge carried by the rightmost bond (which equals `total_charge`).

The left environment at site i carries charge q_L. The right environment at site i carries charge q_R such that q_L + q_W + q_R = total_charge, where q_W is the MPO flux (zero for Hermitian Hamiltonians).

### 16.3 Memory Layout for Environments

At D = 2000, w = 50, T = f64, the full environment tensor (dense) would be D × w × D × 8 bytes ≈ 1.6 GB per environment. With U(1) symmetry, typically 1/√D sectors are occupied, reducing to ~80 MB. Total for N = 100 sites: ~8 GB. A `max_env_memory` parameter (default 8 GB) in `DMRGConfig` triggers disk offloading of the most distant environments (see Implementation Note 3).

### 17.2 Downstream Consumers

| Crate | Usage |
|:------|:------|
| `tk-dmft` | `DMRGEngine`, `TdvpDriver`, `MPS`, `MPO`, `MpoCompiler`, `DmrgResult` |
| `tk-python` | Type-erased through `DmftLoopVariant` enum in `tk-dmft` |

### 17.3 Integration Point: `tk-dsl` -> `tk-dmrg`

`tk-dsl` produces `OpSum<T>`. `MpoCompiler::compile` in `tk-dmrg` is the sole consumer of `OpSum`. This is the hard architectural boundary preventing a cyclic dependency: `tk-dsl` must not import `tk-linalg` (design doc §2.2).

```rust
// Full end-to-end usage:
use tk_dsl::{hamiltonian, SpinOp};
use tk_dmrg::{DMRGEngine, DMRGConfig, MpoCompiler, MpoCompressionConfig,
              MPS, BondDimensionSchedule};
use tk_linalg::DeviceFaer;
use tk_symmetry::U1;

let backend = DeviceFaer;

// Phase 1: compile OpSum -> MPO (runtime SVD compression)
let opsum = hamiltonian! {
    lattice: Chain(N = 100, d = 2);
    sum i in 0..N-1 {
        0.5 * (Sp(i) * Sm(i+1) + Sm(i) * Sp(i+1)) + Sz(i) * Sz(i+1)
    }
};
let mpo: MPO<f64, U1> = MpoCompiler::new(&backend, MpoCompressionConfig {
    max_bond_dim: 50,
    svd_cutoff: 1e-12,
    validate_compression: cfg!(debug_assertions),
    compression_tol: 1e-8,
}).compile(&opsum, 100, &vec![2; 100], U1(0))?;

// Phase 2: run DMRG
let mps = MPS::random(100, &vec![2; 100], 64, U1(0), 50, &mut rng)?;
let mut engine = DMRGEngine::new(mps, mpo, backend, DMRGConfig {
    bond_dim_schedule: BondDimensionSchedule::warmup(64, 500, 5),
    ..DMRGConfig::default()
})?;
let ground_energy: f64 = engine.run()?;
```

    #[test]
    fn mps_left_canonicalize_orthogonality(

    }
}
```

### 18.3 Reference Snapshot Tests

```rust
// fixtures/heisenberg_chain_n20_d500.json  (from ITensor, N=20)
// fixtures/heisenberg_chain_n100_d200.json (from Block2, N=100)
// fixtures/hubbard_n10_u4_d200.json        (from ITensor, N=10)

#[test]
fn heisenberg_n20_energy_matches_itensor() {
    let reference: ReferenceData = load_fixture("heisenberg_chain_n20_d500.json");
    let energy = run_dmrg_heisenberg(n=20, d=500);
    assert!((energy - reference.energy).abs() < 1e-10);
}

fn heisenberg_n100_truncation_error_acceptable() {
    let result = run_dmrg_heisenberg(n=100, d=200);
    assert!(result.max_truncation_error < 1e-6);
}
```

Cross-backend tests use `assert_mps_equivalent!` and `assert_svd_equivalent!` macros to avoid spurious failures from SVD sign gauge freedom (design doc §12.1.1).

fn wrong_gauge_rejected() {
    let mps: MPS<f64, U1, LeftCanonical> = /* ... */;
    // must not compile: dmrg_step_two_site requires MixedCanonical
    let engine = DMRGEngine { mps, /* ... */ };
    engine.dmrg_step_two_site(0, SweepDirection::LeftToRight);
}
```

## 19. Implementation Notes and Design Decisions

### Note 1 — Why In-House Eigensolvers

Off-the-shelf Rust eigensolvers such as `eigenvalues` accept dense matrix types and cannot be adapted to the `Fn(&[T], &mut [T])` closure required for zero-allocation H_eff matvec. Wrapping the effective Hamiltonian in a dense matrix would require materializing a D²d × D²d matrix (up to 64 million elements at D=2000, d=4) — defeating the entire purpose of DMRG. Additionally, in-house implementations allow thick-restart state management and pre-allocation from `SweepArena` that external crates cannot provide. This decision is specified in design doc §8.2 and §11.

### Note 2 — Two-Site vs. Single-Site Updates

The two-site update (§8.2) diagonalizes a rank-4 object of size d²·D² and allows bond dimension growth (SVD can produce up to d·D new singular values per site). It is required for the first warmup sweeps. Single-site updates (§8.2) are O(d D³) per step and cannot grow the bond dimension; they are used for the final convergence sweeps. The `UpdateVariant` enum selects between them. An adaptive policy (start two-site, switch to single-site when truncation error drops below a threshold) can be layered on top of `DMRGConfig`.

### Note 3 — Environment Memory Scaling

For large systems (N=200, D=1000, w=50), full in-memory environment caching requires ~10 GB. Two strategies are available:
1. **On-the-fly recomputation**: Recompute environments from scratch at each sweep-direction reversal. Cost: one extra O(N·d·D²·w) pass per sweep.
2. **Partial caching with disk offload**: Keep only the k nearest environments in memory; serialize distant ones via `checkpoint.rs`. A `max_env_memory` field in `DMRGConfig` (default: 8 GB) triggers this automatically.

The Phase 3 implementation uses full in-memory caching. Disk offloading is deferred pending benchmarks.

### Note 4 — OpSum -> MPO via Finite-State Automaton

The `MpoCompiler` translates `OpSum` terms into an MPO via the finite-state automaton (FSA) method. Each term (e.g., `J * Sz(i) * Sz(i+1)`) defines a path through the FSA, contributing one row/column to the MPO transfer matrix at each site. For nearest-neighbor models, the FSA gives the exact minimal-bond-dim MPO (Heisenberg = 5, Hubbard ≈ 8) without SVD compression. For long-range models the uncompressed bond dim is O(N); SVD compression reduces it to `max_bond_dim`. The standard approach used by ITensor and TeNPy.

### Note 5 — Fermionic Sign Convention

The `tk-contract` engine is bosonic-only (design doc §6.4). Jordan-Wigner strings for fermionic models are encoded in the MPO tensors by `MpoCompiler::compile`. The Jordan-Wigner string operator F = (−1)^N is inserted between fermionic creation/annihilation operators by the compiler. This is correct for all 1D chain and star-to-chain geometries through Phase 4. Native fermionic swap gates for tree/PEPS are deferred to Phase 5+.

### Note 6 — Checkpoint Atomicity

Checkpoint writes use `write_to_temp + rename` to guarantee atomic updates. On POSIX systems, `rename(2)` is atomic within the same filesystem. On Windows, `MoveFileExW` with `MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING` provides similar semantics. The implementation uses `std::fs::rename` across all platforms.

### Note 7 — SU(2) Multiplet-Aware Truncation

Under the `su2-symmetry` feature flag, `truncate_svd` implements two-phase truncation (design doc §4.4):
1. Sort all singular values by magnitude.
2. Snap the truncation boundary to the nearest multiplet edge (never split a 2j+1-degenerate multiplet).
3. Weight discarded values by (2j+1)·σ_i² in the truncation error sum.

`TruncationConfig` is extended (under `su2-symmetry`) with `multiplet_info: Option<Vec<(SU2Irrep, usize)>>` supplying the sector structure. When `None`, standard scalar truncation applies (Abelian path unchanged).

### Note 8 — `DefaultEngine` Type Alias

Per design doc §5.4, only the most common concrete combination is compiled by default:

```rust
#[cfg(all(
    feature = "backend-faer",
    not(any(feature = "backend-mkl", feature = "backend-openblas"))
))]
pub type DefaultEngine = DMRGEngine<f64, tk_symmetry::U1, tk_linalg::DeviceFaer>;
```

Additional combinations (e.g., `Complex<f64>` for real-time TDVP, `Z2` for parity-symmetric models) are compiled only when explicitly requested via feature flags.

### Note 9 — `BitPackable` Should Require `Copy`

The draft implementation found that `BitPackable` not requiring `Clone` (let alone `Copy`) causes ergonomic friction everywhere quantum number values are passed around. All quantum number types (`U1`, `Z2`, `U1Z2`, `SU2Irrep`) are small stack-allocated types (typically 4-8 bytes). Adding `Copy` as a supertrait of `BitPackable` in `tk-symmetry` eliminates pervasive `.clone()` calls with no semantic cost. This is an upstream change in `tk-symmetry`.

### Note 10 — `BlockSparseTensor` Must Implement `Clone`

Without `Clone` on `BlockSparseTensor`, the following features are blocked:
- Excited-state DMRG (penalized states must be cloned into `ExcitedStateConfig`)
- Checkpointing (MPS/MPO snapshots)
- Energy variance computation (`<H^2> - <H>^2` requires a scratch copy of the MPS)
- iDMRG bootstrap (unit-cell tensors are duplicated during system growth)

This is a HIGH SEVERITY issue in the upstream `tk-core` crate.

### Note 11 — `DMRGConfig` Immutable/Mutable Split

The draft implementation revealed that `DMRGConfig` conflates static user-specified configuration with mutable runtime state. Specifically:
- `bond_dim_schedule` is consumed and mutated across sweeps
- `eigensolver` (via `DavidsonSolver::diagonal`) is mutated before each step

Recommend splitting into `DMRGConfig` (immutable, set once before `run()`) and `DMRGState` (mutable, updated by the engine during sweeps). This also resolves the `Clone`/`Debug` derive issue: `DMRGConfig` without `Box<dyn IterativeEigensolver>` can derive both traits. The eigensolver moves to `DMRGState` or is passed as a type parameter.

### Note 12 — Dependency Re-Export Policy

`tk-dmrg` does not re-export any upstream types. Downstream crates (`tk-dmft`, `tk-python`) must add `tk-core`, `tk-symmetry`, `tk-linalg`, `tk-contract`, and `tk-dsl` as direct dependencies to access types like `Scalar`, `BitPackable`, and `LinAlgBackend`. This is burdensome. A `pub use` facade re-exporting the most commonly needed upstream types would improve ergonomics without violating encapsulation.

## 20. Out of Scope

The following are explicitly **not** implemented in `tk-dmrg`:

- DMFT self-consistency loop, bath discretization, Anderson impurity model (-> `tk-dmft`)
- Python bindings and GIL management (-> `tk-python`)
- TEBD (Trotterized time evolution) as a primary method (-> `tk-dmft`; TEBD is a DMFT fallback, not a DMRG concern)
- Linear prediction and Chebyshev expansion for spectral functions (-> `tk-dmft`)
- Multi-dimensional (2D PEPS) or tree tensor network algorithms (-> Phase 5+)
- Native fermionic swap gates in the contraction engine (-> `tk-contract`, Phase 5+)
- MPI-distributed tensor contractions (-> `tk-linalg`/`tk-dmft`, Phase 5+)
- `#[pyclass]` Python-accessible wrappers (-> `tk-python`)
- Block-sparse GEMM dispatch and LPT scheduling (-> `tk-linalg`)
- DAG contraction path optimization (-> `tk-contract`)
- Index types and operator enum definitions (-> `tk-dsl`)

## 21. Open Questions

| # | Question | Status |
|:--|:---------|:-------|
| 1 | Should `Environments` support disk offloading for large systems (D > 1000, N > 100)? Current spec allocates all N environments in RAM. An LRU cache with disk eviction via `checkpoint.rs` may be required before Phase 3 benchmarks. | Open — benchmark environment memory at D=1000, N=100 first |
| 2 | Should `DMRGConfig::eigensolver` be `Box<dyn IterativeEigensolver<f64>>` (current) or `Box<dyn IterativeEigensolver<T>>`? The former requires a separate eigensolver field for complex-valued TDVP; the latter propagates T into DMRGConfig. Draft finding: `Box<dyn IterativeEigensolver<f64>>` works for ground-state DMRG since `f64` is concrete. Complex TDVP needs a separate field. | Resolved — keep `f64` concrete type; add separate complex eigensolver field for TDVP |
| 3 | `DavidsonSolver::diagonal` is mutably set by the engine before each call. Is there a cleaner injection mechanism that does not require mutable state in the solver struct? A `DiagonalPreconditioner` strategy trait may be cleaner. Draft finding: Davidson currently delegates to Lanczos with no preconditioner, so this is moot until the preconditioner is implemented. | Deferred — refactor after Davidson preconditioner is implemented |
| 4 | Should `MpoCompiler` expose an `MpoCompressionStrategy` enum (FSA-only vs. FSA + SVD), or always apply SVD? For short-range models, FSA-only gives the exact minimal-bond-dim MPO; SVD adds overhead. | Open — determine whether the overhead is material during Phase 2 |
| 5 | `run_idmrg` takes a unit-cell MPO (2 sites). For non-trivial unit cells (dimerized chains, multi-orbital Hubbard), the unit cell size should be configurable. Add `unit_cell_size: usize` to `IDmrgConfig`? | Deferred — required only when iDMRG is tested with non-trivial unit cells |
| 6 | Should `energy_variance` be computed during the sweep (at the cost of one extra H² matvec per site, ~50% overhead per sweep) or only on-demand after convergence? The `variance_tol` criterion makes per-sweep computation useful. | Open — profile cost before choosing default |
| 7 | `TruncationConfig::multiplet_info` (SU(2) only) introduces a `Vec<(SU2Irrep, usize)>` into the common truncation path. A `TruncationPolicy` trait (with `select_cutoff` method) may decouple the SU(2)-specific type from the generic code path. | Deferred — `su2-symmetry` is actively implemented |
| 8 | Should `BlockSparseTensor` derive `serde::Serialize` (propagating a `serde` dependency into `tk-symmetry`) or should `tk-dmrg` define its own `SerializedBlockSparseTensor` serialization proxy? Draft finding: checkpointing is currently non-functional because `BlockSparseTensor` lacks `Serialize`. This is a blocking issue. | Open — HIGH PRIORITY; checkpointing is non-functional without resolution |
| 9 | Should `BitPackable` require `Copy` as a supertrait? All quantum number types are small stack-allocated `Copy` types. The current lack of `Copy` causes pervasive `.clone()` calls and ergonomic friction. | Open — upstream change in `tk-symmetry`; recommend resolving before Phase 3 |
| 10 | Should `DMRGConfig` be split into immutable config and mutable state? Current design mixes static configuration with runtime-mutable fields (`bond_dim_schedule`, `eigensolver.diagonal`). The split would also resolve `Clone`/`Debug` derive issues. | Open — recommend splitting before Phase 3 |
| 11 | Should `DMRGEngine` take `&B` or `Arc<B>` for the backend instead of owning `B` by value? Owning limits backend sharing across engines and MPO reuse without cloning. | Open — evaluate ergonomic impact on downstream crates |
| 12 | Should `tk-dmrg` re-export commonly used upstream types (`Scalar`, `BitPackable`, `LinAlgBackend`, `U1`, `Z2`, `BlockSparseTensor`)? Currently each upstream crate must be added as a direct dependency by downstream consumers. | Open — evaluate re-export facade approach |
| 13 | Should `SweepArena` provide a scoped API or guard type to enforce the `into_owned()`-before-`reset()` ordering constraint? The current implicit ordering is easy to violate. | Open — evaluate type-level enforcement approaches |
| 14 | Should the Lanczos tridiagonal solve be upgraded from Sturm bisection O(n^2) to LAPACK `dstev` O(n)? Current approach is fine for small Krylov dimensions but may become a bottleneck. | Deferred — profile after Krylov dimension requirements are established |
